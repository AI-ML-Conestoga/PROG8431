1. mean == sum of points / no of points

2. median  
		arrange in ascending

		Arrange in ascending order: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. 
		Number of data points: There are 7 data points, which is odd. 
		Find the median: (7 + 1) / 2 = 4. The 4th value in the ordered list is 5, so the median is 5. 

3. mode is repeating value

4. variance = summation( (each item in the col - mean)^2)/(total number of rows - 1)

5. SD is square root of variance
